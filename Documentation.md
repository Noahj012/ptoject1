	My problem solving approach for this project was to break the problem 
into small and easily digestable parts that can be tackled one at a time without 
throwing errors in the other methods previously worked on. The parts that I broke
the problem into were the constructor, reading the file, calculating the hamming distance,
calculating node distance, and the toString.
